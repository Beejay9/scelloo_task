# scelloo_task

## Getting Started
Flutter run will run the code. After the application has been built, the posts are fetched and users are navigated to a simple screen where all the fetched posts are displayed. If there is an exception, such as network error, when fetching the post, a message is displayed for the user alongside a button to try to get the posts again. 
users can delete posts made by them with a button on the post card. 
When users click on a post, they are navigated to a screen with the title of the post, the content, and also a button for users to get the comments on that particular post should they choose to.
Users can edit a post made by them by clicking the pencil icon in the post screen.
Users can add posts by clicking the '+' button on the home screen
Unit tests are written in the test files, and all blocs successfully passed the tests
